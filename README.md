# Question

Can we find a signature of distance decay in spatial modules?

# Netowrk building

# Layers as sites


# Flow

We test this querstion when the network layers are islands and when layers are sites.

## Distance decay in species across layers

We find distance decay in species across layers. We test this empirical pattern against null models:
1. Shuffle plants
2. Shuffle pollinators
3. Shuffle both

## Modularity analysis
